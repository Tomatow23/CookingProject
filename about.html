    <p id="about_paragraph">
        This application was originally to be a cooking assistant that would count down the time to a recipe being done cooking and prepping. It was to give an accurate idea as to 
        when the food will be prepared. After consideration as a team we did not find this useful and renamed our concept to Cooking Diary to be a storage for recipes. 
        As technology has increased and changed the way the world operates old family recipes no longer has to rely on just paper or other deteriorating materials. 
        As we have designed this application to hold it for them with a dedicated platform.
